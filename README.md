## Here are some screenshots of all the main fetures of the site


The home page index.html presents information about this school and its purpose, goal and achievements.
On the right-hand side there is a photo composition of young artists.

## Testing

All pages have been tested manually with https://validator.w3.org for html and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ for css. All pages passed all right.

While working on the gallery part a bug was found, the fifth picture didn't show properly. This bug was solved by clearing the flow after the fourth picture.

There are no unfixed bugs.

The site was checked with lighthouse with following report:

Performance: 33

Accessibility 94

Best practices 95

SEO 92

<img src = "assets/images/performance.jpg" alt="Testing outcome">

The reason for the bad performance is probably the gallery. I think the site can get better performance if the gallery is on the whole page not on the half.

## Deployment


The site was deployed on the github.io First I opened the repository, from settings  I chose pages from Code and automation bar. Chose main branch and root folder. And then save.

## Credits

The code for the signup.html was taken from my Love Running project. The form is css validated with successful return of the input.
